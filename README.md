# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses **supervised learning** techniques to detect credit card fraud, utilizing a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on labeled data.

## Project Description

In this project, **supervised learning** is applied to detect fraud in credit card transactions. The dataset includes labeled transactions, with each transaction being classified as either fraudulent(1) or legitimate(0). Machine learning algorithms are used to train a model to predict this target.

### Objectives:
- Classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- Apply data preprocessing techniques.
- Implement supervised learning models for fraud detection, including algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code exploration.
