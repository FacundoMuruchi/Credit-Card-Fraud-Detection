# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses **unsupervised learning** techniques to detect credit card fraud, using a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to identify anomalous patterns in the data that could indicate fraud.

## Project Description

In this project, **unsupervised learning** is applied to detect fraud in credit card transactions. Instead of having pre-labeled fraud data, clustering and anomaly detection algorithms are used to identify suspicious transactions.

### Objectives:
- Detect fraudulent transactions based on anomalous patterns.
- Apply data preprocessing techniques.
- Implement an unsupervised model for fraud detection using **K-means**, **Isolation Forest**, among others.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Numpy**: For handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code exploration.
